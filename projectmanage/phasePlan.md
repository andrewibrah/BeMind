# BeMind App - Efficient Execution Phase Plan

**Project Manager Perspective:** As the project manager for BeMind, a lightweight, coach-like mobile reminders app, I prioritize efficiency to deliver the MVP in 3 months with minimal overhead. Using Agile with 1-week sprints, a lean 3-person team (1 PM/Dev, 1 Dev, 1 Designer/QA), and automated tools, we'll focus on core features first, iterate quickly, and mitigate risks early. Budget: $50K total; track burn rate weekly.

## Phase 1: Kickoff & Planning (Week 1)
- **Efficient Steps:**
  - Day 1-2: Review requirements; finalize MVP scope (groups, tasks, check-ins, basic progress).
  - Day 3: Set up tools (GitHub, Trello for sprints, Firebase).
  - Day 4: Define user stories (10-15); assign priorities (MoSCoW).
  - Day 5: Risk assessment & contingency plan.

- **Deliverables:** Sprint backlog, tech spec.
- **Team Focus:** PM leads; devs audit tech.

## Phase 2: Design & Prototype (Weeks 2-3)
- **Efficient Steps:**
  - Week 2: Sketch wireframes; build clickable prototype (Figma).
  - Week 3: Internal review; quick user feedback (5 users via survey); refine.

- **Deliverables:** Prototype, feedback summary.
- **Team Focus:** Designer builds; devs provide input.

## Phase 3: Development (Weeks 4-10)
- **Efficient Steps:**
  - Sprint 1-2: Setup backend (Firebase auth, schema).
  - Sprint 3-4: Core UI (groups, tasks).
  - Sprint 5-6: Notifications & check-ins.
  - Sprint 7-8: Progress tracking & basic analytics.
  - Daily: Code reviews, automated tests.

- **Deliverables:** Functional MVP.
- **Team Focus:** Devs code; PM removes blockers.

## Phase 4: Testing & Launch Prep (Weeks 11-12)
- **Efficient Steps:**
  - Week 11: Unit tests, bug fixes; beta test (20 users).
  - Week 12: App store prep; performance tweaks.

- **Deliverables:** Launch-ready app.
- **Team Focus:** QA tests; devs fix.

## Phase 5: Launch & Monitor (Week 13+)
- **Efficient Steps:**
  - Day 1: Submit to stores; soft launch.
  - Ongoing: Monitor metrics (downloads, crashes); iterate bi-weekly.

- **Deliverables:** Live app, post-launch report.
- **Team Focus:** PM oversees; team responds to feedback.

**Efficiency Tips:** Automate CI/CD, limit meetings, use templates. Risks: Scope creep (strict backlog); Delays (parallel tasks). Success: 500 downloads in month 1.
